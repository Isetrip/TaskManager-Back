# Test Assignment - Task Manager

Develop a simple Task Management System using Java and the Spring Boot framework.

### Functional requirements:

1. The user should be able to create new tasks with a title, description and priority (low, medium, high).</br>
2. Tasks must have a status (new, in progress, completed) and creation date.</br>
3. The user must be able to view the list of all tasks with their statuses and creation dates.</br>
4. The user must be able to change the status of the task (e.g. mark the task as completed).</br>
5. The user should be able to delete tasks.

### Implementation requirements:

1. Use the Spring Boot framework to create a RESTful API.</br>
2. Use a database to store tasks. It is recommended to use MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL DBMS.</br>
3. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.</br>
4. Implement data validation when creating and updating tasks (e.g. fullness check).</br>
5. Ensure a good system architecture, using OOP principles and clean code.</br>
6. Write tests for the core functionality.

### Bonus tasks (optional, but can add extra points):

1. Implement pagination and sorting when retrieving a task list.</br>
2. Add user authentication and authorisation.</br>
3. Implement the ability to add comments to tasks.</br></br>
You are allowed to use any popular libraries or frameworks to implement the task.
